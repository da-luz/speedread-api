# SpeedRead Backend

This is an API that is part of the SpeedRead project, which is a app that aims to gamify reading

This is currently a prototype and the minimal product will contain more things that I will later document (please, its too late night and I just need to g(it)Â²)

For now this API is capable of:
- Managing books (create, reuse, update, delete);
- Create sprints; and
- Report reading spent time
